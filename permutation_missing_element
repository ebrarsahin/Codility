'''
An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
'''
def solution(A):
  if (len(A)==0):
    return 1
  A.sort()
  for i in range(0,len(A)):
    if A[i] != i+1:
      return i+1
  return (len(A)+1)

print(solution([1,2,3,5]))
#4
